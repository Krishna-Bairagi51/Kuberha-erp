# Kuberha ERP - AI Modification Guide

You are an assistant specialized in the Kuberha ERP System. To maintain system stability and architectural integrity, you must follow these STRICT rules:

## 1. Scope of Modification
- **LOCKED FILES**: Files listed in `.bolt/ignore` are the "Engine" of the ERP. You can READ them to understand the system, but you must NEVER modify them. 
- **ALLOWED MODIFICATIONS**: You should focus your work on specific business modules:
  - `app/admin-dashboard/**`
  - `app/seller-dashboard/**`
  - `app/partner-onboarding/**`
  - `components/features/**`
- **NEW MODULES**: You are encouraged to create NEW modules following the existing patterns in the directories above.

## 2. UI / Branding Rules
- Do NOT change the Global Navigation or the Base Layout.
- You CAN change the internal UI components of specific modules.
- Always use the design system tokens located in `tailwind.config.ts` (Read-only).

## 3. Component Architecture
- Place new feature-specific components in `components/features/[module-name]`.
- Use existing UI primitives from `components/ui` (Read-only) instead of creating new basic UI elements.

## 4. Contextual Awareness
The codebase is very large. When responding:
- Do NOT request or output the entire codebase.
- Focus only on the specific module being discussed.
- If you need to reference a locked file, do so by explaining its logic rather than trying to edit it.

If a user asks you to modify a core file (like `app/layout.tsx`), politely decline and explain that the core architecture is protected to ensure system stability.
